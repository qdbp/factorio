# factorio

This is really a study in a very weird Python coding style.

But it's also an attempt at a collection of factorio solvers that find optimal solutions to hard layout problems.

The stretch goal is to sovle the game -- design the optimal factory for any objective.

## functional solvers

### belt_solver.py

Calculates the optimal input layout for a symmetrical production line of a
certain item.

### balancer_solver.py

Designs splitter-optimal M -> N balancer topologies.

Optimal routing is in the works.
